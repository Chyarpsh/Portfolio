# Portfolio

This portfolio is intentionally kept **simple** and **reliable**.

✅ The full CSS and JS are embedded inside `index.html` as a fallback,
so the site still looks correct even if GitHub Pages caches old files.

## Deploy
- Push `index.html` and your resume PDF
- Open GitHub Pages URL and hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
